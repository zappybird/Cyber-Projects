# Simple Vulnerability Scanner (Educational Cybersecurity Demo)

This project is an educational, transparency-focused tool that demonstrates how dependency scanning and CVE lookups work under the hood.
It parses Python project files, identifies declared dependencies, and prepares them for vulnerability checks using public APIs such as OSV.dev and PyPI.

All modules are currently scaffolds designed for learning, experimentation, and step-by-step implementation.
Every function includes docstrings, comments, and `TODO` markers to guide you through building a real-world vulnerability scanner.

This tool is intended solely for personal cybersecurity learning and defensive research.
Use it only on projects you own and control.

## Features

- Parses `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`
- Normalizes dependency metadata into a shared `Dependency` dataclass
- Prepares OSV batch queries for vulnerability lookups
- Fetches package metadata from the PyPI JSON API
- Fully documented skeletons for:
  - OSV client
  - PyPI client
  - Dependency parsers
  - Scanner orchestrator
- Clean, modular architecture designed for incremental learning
- No external dependencies (except optional `tomli` for Python < 3.11)

All functions currently raise `NotImplementedError` as part of the guided learning structure.

## How It Works

This project is built to teach the architecture of a real dependency scanner.
The flow below outlines the logic you will implement as you progress.

### 1. File Detection

The `scan()` function determines whether the project uses `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`, then routes to the correct parser.

### 2. Dependency Parsing

Each parser extracts package names, version specifiers, inline comments, and format-specific metadata.
All results are normalized into a shared `Dependency` dataclass.

### 3. Metadata Enrichment

The PyPI client will fetch the latest version, handle yanked releases, and apply pre-release filtering rules to ensure accurate vulnerability queries.

### 4. Vulnerability Lookup

The OSV client prepares a batch query and sends it to OSV.dev.
The response is parsed into a list of `Vulnerability` objects.

### 5. Reporting

Future versions will generate CLI output, JSON reports, and severity summaries.

## Installation (from source)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zappybird/Simple-Vulnerability-Scanner.git
cd Simple-Vulnerability-Scanner
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

### 3. Activate it (Windows)

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install optional dependencies (Python < 3.11)

```bash
pip install tomli
```

## Running Tests

A test suite will be added as the scanner logic is implemented.
For now, you can run placeholder tests with:

```bash
python -m unittest
```
