## [0.0.1] — 2026-02-23

### Added

- **`pydepscan/__init__.py`**
  Package initialised with `__version__ = "0.0.1"` and module-level docstring
  summarising the project structure.

- **`pydepscan/scanner.py`**
  Orchestrator skeleton. Defines `scan()` (the top-level public API) and
  `_detect_file_type()` with full docstrings and `TODO` comments marking
  where business logic will be added in future steps.

- **`pydepscan/osv_client.py`**
  OSV.dev API client skeleton. Defines the `Vulnerability` dataclass and
  three functions: `fetch_vulnerabilities()`, `_build_batch_request()`, and
  `_parse_osv_response()`. Documents the OSV batch query contract.

- **`pydepscan/pypi_client.py`**
  PyPI JSON API client skeleton. Defines the `PackageInfo` dataclass and
  `fetch_latest_version()` / `_parse_pypi_response()` with notes on yanked
  release handling (PEP 592) and pre-release filtering.

- **`pydepscan/parsers/__init__.py`**
  Defines the shared `Dependency` dataclass used as the common currency
  between all parsers and the scanner/client modules.

- **`pydepscan/parsers/requirements_parser.py`**
  Parser skeleton for `requirements.txt`. Defines `parse_requirements()`,
  `_parse_specifier_line()`, and `_split_inline_comment()` with detailed
  comments on PEP 508 format and inline-comment edge cases.

- **`pydepscan/parsers/pyproject_parser.py`**
  Parser skeleton for `pyproject.toml`. Handles graceful `tomllib`/`tomli`
  import fallback. Defines `parse_pyproject()`, `_parse_pep621()`, and
  `_parse_poetry()` with notes on format differences between PEP 621 and
  Poetry.

### Notes

- No business logic is implemented yet — all functions raise `NotImplementedError`.
- No external dependencies are introduced; `tomli` is the only optional
  backport (needed only on Python < 3.11).
- Next: implement `version_utils.py` (Step 2).
